# @crustjs/core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#150](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/150) [`ac028c8`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/ac028c8a8694fc4d685ed7140353a881bc92aeb6) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Boolean negation is now alias-symmetric: `--no-<alias>` works for every long alias, matching what man pages and completion scripts already advertised. `noNegate: true` is now enforced by the parser — negating a `noNegate` boolean via any spelling is a `PARSE` error instead of being silently accepted.

- [#139](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/139) [`0ce45f4`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/0ce45f4cd41cc4c9ef4181a23ea6360fd756b49b) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Ship the 0.2 API revamp for the framework spine (see `docs/adr/`). This is a hard cut from the 0.1 API with no compatibility shims; each removed name's replacement is listed below.
  
  - **Extensions replace plugins**: `defineExtension(id, config)` in `@crustjs/core` (ids minted by `defineExtensionId()`) returns a plain frozen config; `.use()` is removed. Extension behavior lives in named `hooks` — `preRun(ctx)` (return `ctx.finish()` to short-circuit successfully), `postRun(ctx, outcome)` (runs in reverse extension order after every settled invocation), and `onError(error, ctx)` (return `true` after rendering an `execute()` failure). Extension-contributed commands are `defineCommand()` definitions (`ExtensionCommand` is removed), and `execute()` offers `AbortError` cancellation to `onError` hooks for central rendering (exit code stays `130`, silent when unclaimed).
  - **`define*` helpers name every definition**: `defineCommand`, `defineContext`, `defineExtension`, `defineFlag`, `defineArg`. Builder methods are variadic and accumulative — `.flags(...defs)` replaces `.flags(record)`, `.args(...defs)` replaces `.args(tuple)` — with statically known duplicate names, spellings, and aliases rejected at compile time through `FIX_*` brands. Runtime checks remain for dynamic command-recipe behavior, Context dependencies, documentation sections, and argv input. Repeating `.action()` replaces the prior action.
  - **Commands are inert reusable definitions**: `defineCommand(name, { description, usage, aliases, hidden }, recipe)` attached with the checked variadic `.add(...definitions)`; use `.as(newName)` to reuse one definition under multiple names. `.sub()`, `.command()`, `.meta()`, and `ChildCrust` are removed; root metadata moves to `new Crust(name, { description, usage })`.
  - **Contexts are declared lazy command dependencies**: `defineContext(name, { flags?, uses? }, setup)` returns a factory attached with `.provide(...instances)` and consumed through lazy `ctx` properties. Contexts, reusable commands, and Extensions declare dependencies with `uses`; composition sites check the graph. Context-owned flags are the only flag-propagation mechanism (`FlagDef.inherit` and `FlagSnapshot.inherit` are removed); `.of(value)` creates dependency-free test doubles; Context values are disposed via `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose` in reverse construction order.
  - **Actions and execution**: `.action(action)` replaces `.handle()` and defines the Command Action; `.run(path, input, { stdout, stderr })` throws for programmatic embedding; `.execute()` renders and sets `process.exitCode`. Builder-level `preRun`/`postRun` are removed — lifecycle work moves to Extension hooks.
  - **Errors**: `CrustError` keeps four stable codes (`DEFINITION`, `PARSE`, `VALIDATION`, `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`); `_tag`, `CONFIG`, and `EXECUTION` are removed; action and Context errors pass through unwrapped.
  - **Validation**: Standard Schema is supported directly on arg/flag definitions; `@crustjs/validate` is removed.
  - **Tooling**: `Crust.snapshot()` is the supported API for frozen, validated Command Snapshots; public `CommandNode`/`prepareCommandTree()` are removed, and man/crust/skills render help, man pages, and Agent Skills from one shared command documentation model.
  - **Generics**: the generic parameters on `Crust`, `CommandDefinitionBuilder`, and the Context types were reordered and re-purposed; prefer inference over positional annotations.
  - `create-crust` ships a single minimal template.

- [#307](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/307) [`e3b196a`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/e3b196a0d300790b95e9417324b05ae2371d24ce) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Unify build-time artifact generation behind Extension build hooks and a single snapshot protocol.
  
  - Extensions can expose a `build(ctx)` hook for build-time artifact generation. The context carries the frozen root Command Snapshot and a resolved absolute output directory; snapshots are refreshed between hooks so later generators see sections derived from earlier hooks' outputs.
  - `crust build` runs build hooks from every registered Extension in registration order. Extension presence is the source of intent — the `--man` flag is removed, and `--no-validate` is the single opt-out that skips entry preparation and all build hooks. npm package staging includes every top-level artifact directory emitted by hooks; the name `bin` is reserved for the generated npm executables.
  - Build validation and artifact generation share one subprocess-only snapshot-file protocol. `@crustjs/core/tooling` exports `SNAPSHOT_PATH_ENV` (replacing `VALIDATION_MODE_ENV` and `VALIDATION_FORCE_EXIT_ENV`), and man-page generation no longer requires the entry module to export its app. Entries that never call `await app.execute()` previously passed validation vacuously; they now fail with an actionable missing-snapshot error (use `--no-validate` if intentional).
  - New `man(options?)` in `@crustjs/man`: a build-only Extension that writes an mdoc page under the build output's `man` directory. Section 1 is the default; `man({ section })` selects another section and `man({ name })` sets the installed command name. `writeManPage()` remains for custom pipelines and now accepts a prepared Command Snapshot as `root` instead of a live app.
  - The `skill()` Extension in `@crustjs/skills` contributes a build hook that writes packaged skills under the build output's `skills` directory: it copies an available packaged source wholesale and otherwise renders from the prepared Command Snapshot.

- [#307](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/307) [`e3b196a`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/e3b196a0d300790b95e9417324b05ae2371d24ce) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Enforce definition-shape validation once, at compile time where possible.
  
  - Compile-time `FIX_*` brands own statically checkable mistakes: variadic placement, flag defaults outside literal `choices` (`FIX_DEFAULT_CHOICE`), spelling/name/alias collisions, empty flag spellings and command/argument names, reserved `__proto__` spellings, `no-` prefixes, schema exclusivity, parser synchronicity, section audience exclusivity, and dependency closure — consistently across `.flags()`, `.args()`, `.add()`, `.provide()`, `.extend()`, `defineContext`, and `defineExtension`.
  - `defineExtension()` flags are authored as a readonly array of named definitions, matching `.flags()` and `defineContext()`; statically known Extension collisions are rejected at compile time — command collisions within one Extension tuple, with authored commands, or with other Extensions (`FIX_COMMAND_COLLISION`), and flag collisions against application flags and earlier Extensions (`FIX_ALIAS_COLLISION`).
  - Dynamically assembled definitions (config-built flags, args, commands, Extensions) fail loud with `DEFINITION` errors at the same composition points instead of silently misbehaving. Runtime otherwise validates only what types cannot see: argv values, dynamic strings, recipe behavior, and transitive dependencies above an `.of()` cut.
  - Routing hardening: argv tokens matching inherited `Object.prototype` keys (`mycli constructor`, `mycli __proto__`) report `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND` instead of crashing, and typed `run()` positional/flag lookups no longer resolve inherited keys.

- [#307](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/307) [`e3b196a`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/e3b196a0d300790b95e9417324b05ae2371d24ce) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Add a shared documentation-section model with audience filtering.
  
  - Commands can define plain-text `meta.sections`, and Extensions can append sections to canonical command paths during application preparation. Help and man-page output render the merged per-command sections after their built-in content, and generated man pages include sections from visible subcommands.
  - Sections are visible to every renderer by default; `only` and `except` select audiences. Audiences accept Extension and renderer factory objects directly (`only: [skill]`), branded `ExtensionId` values minted by `defineExtensionId()` for custom renderers, and official renderer identities on factory statics (`help.id`, `man.id`, `skill.id`). The `crust:*` id namespace is reserved for official Extensions.
  - Extensions are identified by branded ids: `defineExtension(defineExtensionId("acme:feature"), config)` — and expose that identity as `.id`. Handled `execute()` failures are attributed through `InvocationOutcome.by`; compare with factory statics, e.g. `outcome.by === help.id`. Core fallback rendering leaves `outcome.by` undefined.
  - For `execute()` failures reached during dispatch, `onError` now settles before `postRun`. Invocation Contexts remain pullable through `onError` and `postRun` before disposal.
  - Application-authored "Agent skills" sections are preserved in generated skills.

- [#152](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/152) [`ff01466`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/ff01466931a7f0616ac01e9ea6be2285f702344f) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Routing now skips known flags (and their values) that appear before a subcommand name, so `app --quiet translate` runs `translate` instead of silently resolving the root without an action and exiting 0. All parser-accepted spellings are recognized during routing: long names, `--flag=value`, `--no-<name>` negation (respecting `noNegate`), short flags and inline values, long aliases, and bundled short booleans. Unknown flags and the `--` terminator still stop routing as before.
  
  Behavior changes:
  
  - Recursive flags placed before a subcommand bind to the subcommand's invocation — e.g. `app --help sub` shows `sub`'s help (previously the root's).
  - A pre-subcommand flag the routed subcommand cannot parse fails at routing with an actionable `PARSE` error (`Flag "--quiet" cannot be used before subcommand "sub" because "sub" does not accept it.`) instead of a confusing unknown-flag error or silent no-op. Propagating (Context-owned and recursive Extension) flags keep routing through.

- [#307](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/307) [`e3b196a`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/e3b196a0d300790b95e9417324b05ae2371d24ce) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Modernize the runtime support matrix and package builds.
  
  - Supported runtimes: Bun 1.3.14+, Node.js 22+, and Deno 2.8+. Package runtime code is portable across all three — Bun globals are replaced with Node-compatible built-ins, and process spawning uses `node:child_process`. On runtimes without `AsyncDisposableStack` (Node 22/23), invocations fall back to an in-package disposal stack.
  - Package builds migrate to tsdown (Rolldown) and modules are marked side-effect free. Internal `@crustjs/utils` imports are inlined, fixing `@crustjs/store` installs that previously required `@crustjs/utils` at runtime. Consumers bundling with Bun 1.3.10–1.3.13 may encounter oven-sh/bun#27709 when tree-shaking packages with `sideEffects: false`.
  - All packages that ship type declarations declare an optional `typescript: "^7.0.0"` peerDependency. Builder inference performance is measured and supported against the native TypeScript 7 compiler; plain-JavaScript consumers are unaffected.

- [#307](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/307) [`e3b196a`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/e3b196a0d300790b95e9417324b05ae2371d24ce) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Add end-to-end typed programmatic invocation.
  
  - `run(path, input?, io?)` infers command paths, arguments, and flags from the application definition while still exercising the normal argv parser pipeline. Raw argv invocation remains available through `execute()`, which now also accepts an optional `io` override alongside `argv`.
  
  ```ts
  const outcome = await app.run(["remote", "add"], {
    args: { name: "origin" },
    flags: { fetch: true },
  });
  if (outcome.status === "completed") console.log(outcome.result);
  ```
  
  - `run()` resolves to a `RunOutcome` discriminated union: `completed` owns the selected action's typed `result`, while `finished` owns the identity of the Extension whose `preRun` hook ended the invocation.
  - Statically declared Extension commands and flags merge into typed `run()` paths and inputs; widened, conditionally assembled, or variable-length contributions stay runtime-only. Extension-owned flag values are inferred in `defineExtension()` hook contexts (command-specific flags remain `unknown`, root-only flags include `undefined`).
  - String flags/args with literal `choices` narrow to the union of those values: `{ type: "string", choices: ["staging", "production"] as const }` infers `"staging" | "production"` in the action. Widened `readonly string[]` choices still infer `string`, and `parse` still owns the output type when present.
  - The `Simplify` helper type is exported from the package root, so consumers with `declaration: true` exporting inferred definitions no longer hit TS2742/TS2883.

### Patch Changes

- [#307](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/pull/307) [`e3b196a`](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust/commit/e3b196a0d300790b95e9417324b05ae2371d24ce) Thanks [@chenxin-yan](https://github.com/chenxin-yan)! - Faster startup and type-checking.
  
  - Core reuses its prepared invocation tree across repeated dispatches, and completion renderers and skill implementation modules are deferred until first use. Extension command recipes materialize once per builder instance instead of on every run — recipes must stay inert, per the documented contract.
  - Long `.flags()` chains hit `TS2589` about 3x later, the `.provide()` chain ceiling is removed, and `ctx` inference no longer silently degrades on long `.provide()` chains.

## 0.0.19

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e298f11]
  - @crustjs/utils@0.0.3

## 0.0.18

### Patch Changes

- 0dc69b1: Introduce `@crustjs/utils`, fold in `@crustjs/schema-utils`, dedupe `resolveSourceDir`, and switch validated helpers to explicit Standard Schema-backed validation.

  **`@crustjs/utils` (new, `0.0.1`)** — Pre-stable; public surface may change without notice until `0.1.0`. Pin to an exact version if depending externally.

  - `resolveSourceDir(input: string | URL): string` for three-mode source-directory resolution (`file:` URL via `fileURLToPath`, absolute path via `path.resolve`, or relative path resolved from the nearest `package.json` walking up from `process.argv[1]`).
  - `@crustjs/utils/schema` subpath exposes Standard Schema boundary assertions, issue normalization, and type aliases (`assertStandardSchema`, `isStandardSchema`, `formatPath`, `normalizeStandardIssues`, `normalizeStandardPath`, plus `StandardSchema` / `InferInput` / `InferOutput` / `ValidationIssue`). Internal-only — **not part of the public Crust API** and may change without a deprecation cycle. Use `@crustjs/validate` instead.
  - `@crustjs/utils/schema` is core-free shared infrastructure; package-specific APIs wrap errors at their own boundaries.

  **`@crustjs/schema-utils` removed.** The standalone workspace package is gone; its surface lives at `@crustjs/utils/schema`. The published `@crustjs/schema-utils@0.0.1` artifact on npm will be deprecated separately.

  **`@crustjs/core`, `@crustjs/validate`, `@crustjs/store` — raw schema-backed validation.** Vendor-specific schema introspection is removed; validated helpers now use Standard Schema validation over parsed values. `arg()`, `flag()`, and `field()` no longer infer type, requiredness, descriptions, multiplicity, or defaults from Zod/Effect internals. Missing values are passed to validation as `undefined`, so schema `.optional()` and `.default()` behavior applies naturally at runtime.

  - Validated positional args can omit parser `type`; they validate the raw positional string (or string array for variadic args) through the schema.
  - Validated CLI flags must declare parser `type` because it defines CLI grammar/token ownership: boolean flags do not consume a value, while string/number flags consume `--flag value` / `--flag=value`. Schemas validate and transform after parsing.
  - Descriptions must now be supplied through Crust options.
  - The internal `@crustjs/utils/schema` introspection exports (`inferOptions`, `extractDefault`, and related types) were removed.
  - This is a public behavior change for metadata-driven parser/help/store consumers: add explicit Crust metadata (`type`, `multiple`, `description`, `default`, etc.) where that metadata is still needed.

  **`@crustjs/create`, `@crustjs/skills` — internal dedup onto `resolveSourceDir`.** Public signatures and behavior of `createProject()` and `installSkillBundle()` are unchanged, but the wording of three thrown `Error` messages now comes from the shared helper:

  - `"Template URL must use file: protocol, got ..."` / `"Bundle URL must use file: protocol, got ..."` → `"sourceDir URL must use file: protocol, got ..."`
  - `"Could not resolve relative template path ..."` / `"Could not resolve relative bundle path ..."` → `"Could not resolve relative sourceDir ..."` (both `process.argv[1]` unset and missing-`package.json` variants)

  Consumers that match on `Error.message` text from these three failure modes will need to update their patterns. All other thrown messages (`Template directory does not exist`, `Template path is not a directory`, path-traversal rejection, `Bundle source directory does not exist`, missing `SKILL.md`, destination-conflict, etc.) are unchanged.

  The `@internal`-tagged `resolveBundleSourceDir` export from `@crustjs/skills/bundle` was removed. It carried `@internal` JSDoc and was undocumented (exported only for direct unit-test access); its behavior is preserved by `resolveSourceDir` from `@crustjs/utils`.

- d08439a: Internal refactor: `ValueType`, `ResolvePrimitive`, and number coercion now use shared `@crustjs/utils` primitives with no consumer-visible behavior change.
- c4d2b22: Extend `ValueType` with `"url"`, `"path"`, and `"json"` (resolving to `URL`, absolute `string`, and `unknown`). Add a `parse?: (raw: string) => unknown` escape hatch on `StringFlagDef`/`StringMultiFlagDef`/`StringArgDef`; every non-string variant declares `parse?: never`, so misuse is rejected at compile time. Async `parse` functions are rejected at command setup via a new `CONFIG` error code. Fix: when `parse` is set and argv is absent but `default` is present, `parse(String(default))` now runs so the runtime value matches the inferred type. **Behavior change:** `choices` on string flags/args is now enforced at parse time (previously hint-only); raw argv is validated against `choices` before any `parse` transform runs.
- c4d2b22: Review-driven follow-ups to the value-type and parse-escape-hatch work:

  - `type: "path"` flag/arg defaults now run through `coercePath` so omitting the flag yields the same absolute path users get when they pass it on the command line (`{ type: "path", default: "./dist" }` previously returned the raw relative string).
  - `choices` is now validated against `default` values in both the parse and non-parse default branches, mirroring argv-side enforcement so `{ choices: ["a","b"], default: "z" }` can't be silently accepted while `--flag z` throws.
  - Re-export the documented `Resolve<T>` and `ResolveBaseType<F>` type helpers from `@crustjs/core` so consumers can `import type { Resolve, ResolveBaseType } from "@crustjs/core"` as the API reference shows.

- Updated dependencies [0dc69b1]
- Updated dependencies [d08439a]
  - @crustjs/utils@0.0.2

## 0.0.17

### Patch Changes

- b87e0ee: Add `choices` to `FlagDef`/`ArgDef` and `hidden` to `CommandMeta`.

  Two purely-additive optional fields on the `@crustjs/core` public type surface:

  - **`choices?: readonly string[]`** on string-typed flag and arg variants
    (`StringFlagDef`, `StringMultiFlagDef`, `StringArgDef`) — a static enum of
    valid values for the flag/arg.

    ```ts
    flags: {
      target: { type: "string", choices: ["browser", "bun", "node"] },
    }
    ```

    `choices` is a **hint for tooling** consumed by shell-completion tooling
    to emit static value candidates and may be consumed by future opt-in
    validation. It is **NOT** enforced at parse time in this version: passing
    a value outside `choices` does not throw, the value is still parsed as a
    string and delivered to your handler. Validate explicitly inside your
    handler if you need runtime rejection today. Adding `choices` to
    number/boolean variants is a compile-time error.

  - **`hidden?: boolean`** on `CommandMeta` — omits a command from any
    tooling that enumerates the command tree for users (help output, man
    pages, skill descriptors, completion candidate lists, etc.).

    ```ts
    meta: { name: "__complete", hidden: true, description: "Internal" }
    ```

    Listing-only: the command stays fully invocable by name (or alias),
    routing is unchanged, and it can still surface through tooling that
    looks up specific commands rather than enumerating the tree (e.g.
    `didYouMeanPlugin`). The default `helpPlugin` (in `@crustjs/plugins`)
    follows this contract today; first-party generators and custom
    renderers should too.

  Both fields are purely additive at the type level — existing code that
  does not set `choices` or `hidden` is unchanged. The parser is
  unmodified.

- f1baa45: Add `aliases` to `CommandMeta`.

  Commands and subcommands can now declare alternative names that resolve to the same command node:

  ```ts
  new Crust("my-cli").command("issue", (cmd) =>
    cmd.meta({ aliases: ["issues", "i"] }).run(() => {})
  );
  // my-cli issue, my-cli issues, and my-cli i all route to the same command
  ```

  The change is purely additive at the type level — existing code that does not set `aliases` is unchanged. `resolveCommand` gains a fast path that scans sibling `meta.aliases` on miss; `commandPath` continues to record the canonical name only, so error messages, help titles, and downstream plugins are unaffected by which alias the user typed. `CrustError("COMMAND_NOT_FOUND")`'s `details.available` keeps its canonical-only contract — alias-aware consumers (e.g. `didYouMeanPlugin`) read aliases directly from `details.parentCommand.subCommands`.

  Alias collisions are eagerly rejected at registration time with `CrustError("DEFINITION", …)`. Plugin-installed subcommands (via the `addCommand` setup action) get the same check and are skipped with a warning if their canonical name or any alias collides — mirroring how a colliding canonical name was already handled. `validateCommandTree` re-runs the full check against the final tree. An alias may not equal the command's own canonical name, any sibling's canonical name, or any sibling's alias; aliases must be non-empty, contain no whitespace, and not start with `-`.

- 8779692: Make the `choices`, `meta.aliases`, and `meta.hidden` contracts consistent
  across every consumer (help, did-you-mean, man, completion).

  A cross-consumer audit found three gaps:

  - `helpPlugin` rendered output omitted the `choices` list for both flags
    and positional args, so users could not discover valid values from
    `--help` without resorting to shell completion or source-reading.
  - `didYouMeanPlugin` and the `@crustjs/man` manpage generator both
    walked the command tree without filtering `meta.hidden: true`, so
    internal commands (e.g. `__complete`) leaked into typo suggestions,
    the "Available commands" fallback, and published man pages.
  - `@crustjs/man` omitted long flag aliases (`def.aliases`) and `choices`
    from the OPTIONS / ARGUMENTS sections, leaving the man page strictly
    less informative than `--help`.
  - The completion plugin's bash and fish templates only surfaced
    `choices` for the **first** positional argument; zsh respected every
    slot. Variadic-with-choices arguments and multi-positional commands
    silently fell through to file completion in bash/fish.

  Changes:

  - `helpPlugin` renders `[choices: a, b, c]` after the description for
    every flag and arg that declares a `choices` list, composed with
    `[default: ...]` when both are present.
  - `didYouMeanPlugin` skips `meta.hidden: true` siblings in both the
    Levenshtein suggestion corpus (canonical names **and** aliases) and
    the "Available commands" fallback list.
  - `@crustjs/man` filters `meta.hidden: true` subcommands from the
    SUBCOMMANDS section (and skips the section entirely when every
    subcommand is hidden), surfaces flag and arg `choices` as a
    `[choices: ...]` suffix, and includes long flag aliases in OPTIONS
    labels (`-o, --output, --out`, plus `--no-` negation for every long
    spelling on boolean flags).
  - `completionPlugin` bash and fish templates now track positional slot
    index past the resolved command path and emit per-slot choice
    candidates. Variadic-with-choices arguments are handled correctly
    (the choice list applies at every slot from the variadic's declared
    index onwards). The fish template gains a second per-script helper
    `__<ident>_path_at_arg` that the existing `__<ident>_path_is` is
    layered alongside; subcommand and flag rules continue to use the
    original predicate.

  Core / docs:

  - `CommandMeta.hidden` JSDoc now enumerates every tooling surface the
    flag affects (help, completion, did-you-mean, man, skills) and is
    explicit that there is intentionally no analogous `FlagDef.hidden` —
    the workaround for flag-level hiding is to register without a
    description.

- 9db2613: Make build-validation mode safe for in-process callers.

  `Crust.execute()` no longer calls `process.exit()` when only
  `CRUST_INTERNAL_VALIDATE_ONLY=1` is set — it now runs the validation
  pipeline, surfaces errors via stderr and `process.exitCode`, and returns
  like the rest of `.execute()`'s error paths. Process termination is
  opt-in via the new `CRUST_INTERNAL_VALIDATE_FORCE_EXIT=1` env var, which
  `crust build`'s `validateEntrypoint()` sets on its spawned subprocess.

  For end users there is no change: `crust build` now sets both env vars on
  its validation subprocess, preserving the existing behavior of skipping
  entrypoint code after `await app.execute()` during the build check.
  Tests and embedders that need to exercise the validation pipeline can
  now do so without being terminated.

## 0.0.16

### Patch Changes

- def425e: Restrict `noNegate` to boolean flag types only

  Moved `noNegate` from the shared `FlagDefBase` interface to `BooleanFlagDef` and `BooleanMultiFlagDef`. Setting `noNegate` on a non-boolean flag (e.g. string or number) is now a compile-time error instead of being silently ignored at runtime.

## 0.0.15

### Patch Changes

- 5e0afa4: Fix inherited flags not being applied to subcommand trees injected by plugins. The help flag (`-h`) now correctly inherits into plugin-added subcommands.

## 0.0.14

### Patch Changes

- f78b327: Decouple parsing from validation: `parseArgs()` is now a pure parse+coerce function that never throws for missing required values. A new `validateParsed()` function handles required-value constraints separately. This fixes `--help` showing an error instead of help text when required args are missing.

## 0.0.13

### Patch Changes

- 6dea64c: Handle Ctrl+C prompt cancellations more gracefully. Prompt rendering now moves to a fresh line on cancel, and `Crust.execute()` treats `CancelledError` as a silent user abort with exit code `130` instead of printing `Error: Prompt was cancelled.`.

## 0.0.12

### Patch Changes

- b8ebfa4: Refine skill plugin ergonomics and tighten core public API boundaries.

  - `@crustjs/skills`:

    - `skillPlugin` now uses `command?: string` (default: `"skill"`) instead of `boolean | string`.
    - `skillPlugin` option `scope` was replaced with `defaultScope`.
    - Interactive scope selection now prompts for `project`/`global` only when `defaultScope` is not provided; non-interactive fallback is `global`.
    - Auto-update now checks both `project` and `global` install paths for the current cwd and reports scope in update messaging.
    - Added `skill update` subcommand for manual update-only runs.

  - `@crustjs/core`:
    - Removed `createCommandNode` and `computeEffectiveFlags` from the root `@crustjs/core` export surface.
    - High-level `Crust` builder usage is now the recommended path for command construction.

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 9f81bcc: Preserve effective flag typing across `Crust` builder chains by carrying an internal `Eff` generic, and short-circuit `EffectiveFlags` for wide inherited flag types to reduce TypeScript type-check overhead.
- 72ea166: Reduce TypeScript type-check overhead in large projects by removing compile-time inherited/local flag cross-collision validation from `Crust#flags()`. Runtime collision checks remain in argument parsing and command-tree validation.

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 96ca6b2: Adopt the new builder-style command API across core and official packages, including inherited flags, lifecycle hooks, plugin usage, and command metadata improvements. Update related tooling, templates, and documentation to align with the new command authoring flow.

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- a1f233e: Enable minification for all package builds, reducing bundle sizes by ~27%. Also shorten error messages in `@crustjs/core` for smaller output.
- e3624b2: Add pre-compile validation to `crust build`. Before compiling, the build command now spawns your entry file in a validation-only subprocess to check the full command tree (including plugin-injected flags and subcommands) for definition errors such as flag alias collisions and reserved `no-` prefix misuse. Disable with `--no-validate`.

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- 384e2a9: Add `addSubCommand` to plugin `SetupActions`, allowing plugins to inject subcommands during setup. User-defined subcommands take priority over plugin-injected ones. `Command.subCommands` is now always initialized (non-optional).

  Redesign `@crustjs/skills` from a build-time CLI tool into a runtime plugin. `skillPlugin()` handles auto-update of installed skills and optionally registers an interactive `skill` subcommand via `addSubCommand`. Skill metadata (name, description) is derived from the root command — only `version` needs to be supplied. Remove `createSkillCommand` and `SkillCommandOptions` from public API.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- 1364768: Harden boolean flag parsing by reserving the `no-` prefix for canonical negation only: reject `no-`-prefixed flag names/aliases at definition time, disallow `--no-<alias>` in favor of `--no-<canonical>`, and return clearer parse errors for invalid boolean value assignment forms like `--flag=true`.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 8c23587: Add `@crustjs/validate` package with Zod 4 and Effect schema-first validation for CLI commands.

  `defineZodCommand` uses Zod schemas as the single source of truth — parser definitions, help text, runtime validation, and handler types are all derived from the schemas. Includes `arg()` and `flag()` DSL helpers, compile-time variadic/alias validation, and structured `CrustError("VALIDATION")` errors.

  Core changes: export `ValidateFlagAliases` and `ValidateVariadicArgs` utilities, add `ValidationErrorDetails` type to `VALIDATION` error code, and generalize compile-time validation types to work with any record/tuple shape.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 8e0b48a: Fix published package metadata containing unresolved workspace and catalog protocols by switching to bun publish

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 115d396: revamp type system for args and flags for better UX when working with defineCommand
- 9b951e9: fix alias collision error message to use correct prefix for multi-letter aliases
- bdd101f: improve compile-time validation errors to show per-item granularity with descriptive branded properties
- dcc258c: switch to use literal string for flags and args types

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Update domain to crustjs.com, update dependencies, add homepage, and remove flaky cross-compilation tests
