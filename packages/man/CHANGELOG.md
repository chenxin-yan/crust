## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8779692: Make the `choices`, `meta.aliases`, and `meta.hidden` contracts consistent
  across every consumer (help, did-you-mean, man, completion).

  A cross-consumer audit found three gaps:

  - `helpPlugin` rendered output omitted the `choices` list for both flags
    and positional args, so users could not discover valid values from
    `--help` without resorting to shell completion or source-reading.
  - `didYouMeanPlugin` and the `@crustjs/man` manpage generator both
    walked the command tree without filtering `meta.hidden: true`, so
    internal commands (e.g. `__complete`) leaked into typo suggestions,
    the "Available commands" fallback, and published man pages.
  - `@crustjs/man` omitted long flag aliases (`def.aliases`) and `choices`
    from the OPTIONS / ARGUMENTS sections, leaving the man page strictly
    less informative than `--help`.
  - The completion plugin's bash and fish templates only surfaced
    `choices` for the **first** positional argument; zsh respected every
    slot. Variadic-with-choices arguments and multi-positional commands
    silently fell through to file completion in bash/fish.

  Changes:

  - `helpPlugin` renders `[choices: a, b, c]` after the description for
    every flag and arg that declares a `choices` list, composed with
    `[default: ...]` when both are present.
  - `didYouMeanPlugin` skips `meta.hidden: true` siblings in both the
    Levenshtein suggestion corpus (canonical names **and** aliases) and
    the "Available commands" fallback list.
  - `@crustjs/man` filters `meta.hidden: true` subcommands from the
    SUBCOMMANDS section (and skips the section entirely when every
    subcommand is hidden), surfaces flag and arg `choices` as a
    `[choices: ...]` suffix, and includes long flag aliases in OPTIONS
    labels (`-o, --output, --out`, plus `--no-` negation for every long
    spelling on boolean flags).
  - `completionPlugin` bash and fish templates now track positional slot
    index past the resolved command path and emit per-slot choice
    candidates. Variadic-with-choices arguments are handled correctly
    (the choice list applies at every slot from the variadic's declared
    index onwards). The fish template gains a second per-script helper
    `__<ident>_path_at_arg` that the existing `__<ident>_path_is` is
    layered alongside; subcommand and flag rules continue to use the
    original predicate.

  Core / docs:

  - `CommandMeta.hidden` JSDoc now enumerates every tooling surface the
    flag affects (help, completion, did-you-mean, man, skills) and is
    explicit that there is intentionally no analogous `FlagDef.hidden` —
    the workaround for flag-level hiding is to register without a
    description.

### Patch Changes

- f1baa45: `mdoc` includes command aliases in the SUBCOMMANDS section.

  When a subcommand declares `aliases` on its `meta`, the rendered man page lists them inline next to the canonical name on the `.It Nm` line — e.g. `.It Nm issue (issues, i)` — matching the inline format used by `helpPlugin`. Subcommands without aliases render unchanged. The `.Bl -tag -width` directive's column width is recalculated to fit the longest combined label so alignment stays consistent.

  Requires `aliases` on `CommandMeta`, added in the same release of `@crustjs/core`.
