`@crustjs/validate` will provide input validation and coercion utilities for CLI arguments and flags.

Planned features include:
- Schema-based validation for args and flags
- Custom validators and coercion functions
- Composable validation pipelines
- Helpful error messages for invalid input

Check back for updates, or follow the [Crust repository](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust) for progress.
