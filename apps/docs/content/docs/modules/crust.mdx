description: Core + plugins bundle with CLI tooling.

The `@crustjs/crust` package is the recommended way to use Crust. It re-exports everything from `@crustjs/core` and `@crustjs/plugins` through a single import, and provides the `crust` CLI binary.

## Install

```sh
bun add @crustjs/crust
```

## What's Included

### Re-exports

Everything from `@crustjs/core` and `@crustjs/plugins` is available under one import:

```ts
// All of these come from a single package
import {
  // From @crustjs/core
  defineCommand,
  parseArgs,
  resolveCommand,
  runCommand,
  runMain,
  CrustError,

  // From @crustjs/plugins
  helpPlugin,
  versionPlugin,
  autoCompletePlugin,
  renderHelp,
} from "@crustjs/crust";
```

### CLI Binary

The package includes the `crust` CLI, which provides:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`crust build`](/docs/guide/build) | Compile your CLI to standalone executables |

The `crust` CLI is itself built with Crust (self-hosted), demonstrating the framework in action.

## Usage

```ts title="src/cli.ts"
#!/usr/bin/env bun

import { defineCommand, helpPlugin, runMain, versionPlugin } from "@crustjs/crust";
import pkg from "../package.json";

const main = defineCommand({
  meta: {
    name: "my-cli",
    description: "My CLI tool",
  },
  run() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  },
});

runMain(main, {
  plugins: [versionPlugin(pkg.version), helpPlugin()],
});
```

## When to Use

`@crustjs/crust` is recommended for:
- All CLI application projects
- The simplest possible setup with a single dependency
- Projects that need the `crust build` command for distribution

Use the individual modules (`@crustjs/core`, `@crustjs/plugins`) if you're building a library on top of Crust or need minimal dependencies.
