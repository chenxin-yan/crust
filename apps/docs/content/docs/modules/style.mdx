Planned features include:
- ANSI color support (foreground, background, modifiers)
- Automatic color detection and fallback
- Composable style chains
- Theme support
- Text decoration (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, dim)

Check back for updates, or follow the [Crust repository](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust) for progress.
