  This package is **coming soon** and not yet available.
</Callout>

`@crustjs/log` will provide structured logging utilities for CLI applications.

Planned features include:
- Structured logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Colorized output
- Log prefixing and scoping
- Configurable verbosity (`--verbose` / `--quiet` flags)

Check back for updates, or follow the [Crust repository](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust) for progress.
