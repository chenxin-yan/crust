  This package is **coming soon** and not yet available.
</Callout>

`@crustjs/create` will provide a library for building `create-xx` scaffolding tools, similar to `create-vite` or `create-next-app`.

Planned features include:
- Template discovery and selection
- File scaffolding with variable interpolation
- Interactive project setup prompts
- Git initialization
- Dependency installation
- Post-scaffold hooks

Check back for updates, or follow the [Crust repository](https://github.com/chenxin-yan/crust) for progress.
