<Callout>
  If you're starting a new project, the easiest way is `bun create crust my-cli`. See the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide.
</Callout>

## Unified Package (Recommended)

The `@crustjs/crust` package re-exports everything from `@crustjs/core` and `@crustjs/plugins` in a single import, plus provides the `crust` CLI binary for building.

```sh
bun add @crustjs/crust
```

```ts title="src/cli.ts"
// Everything from one import
import { defineCommand, helpPlugin, runMain, versionPlugin } from "@crustjs/crust";
```

This is the recommended approach for most projects. You get the core framework, official plugins, and the `crust` CLI binary in a single dependency.

## Composable Modules

If you want finer control over your dependencies, install the individual modules:

```sh
# Core framework only (commands, parsing, routing, errors)
bun add @crustjs/core

# Add official plugins (help, version, autocomplete)
bun add @crustjs/plugins

# Add CLI tooling (crust build) as a dev dependency
bun add -d @crustjs/crust
```

```ts title="src/cli.ts"
import { defineCommand, runMain } from "@crustjs/core";
import { helpPlugin, versionPlugin } from "@crustjs/plugins";
```

<Callout>
  Even with composable modules, you'll want `@crustjs/crust` as a **dev dependency** for the CLI toolings. It's only needed at build time, not at runtime.
</Callout>

This is useful when you:
- Only need the core framework without plugins
- Want to minimize your runtime dependency footprint
- Are building a library on top of Crust's core

## Minimal Setup

Here's the minimal code to create a working CLI:

```ts title="src/cli.ts"
#!/usr/bin/env bun

import { defineCommand, runMain } from "@crustjs/crust";

const main = defineCommand({
  meta: { name: "my-cli", description: "My CLI tool" },
  run() {
    console.log("Hello from my CLI!");
  },
});

runMain(main);
```

Run it:

```sh
bun run src/cli.ts
```

## Adding to package.json

For a distributable CLI, configure your `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "bin": {
    "my-cli": "dist/cli.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "crust build",
    "dev": "bun run src/cli.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@crustjs/crust": "latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

## Requirements

- **Bun** — Crust is built for the Bun runtime. Install from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).
- **TypeScript** — Recommended for full type inference. Crust works with plain JavaScript, but you'll miss out on typed args and flags.
