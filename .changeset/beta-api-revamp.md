Ship the 0.2 API revamp for the framework spine (see `docs/adr/0001`–`0009`). This is a hard cut from the 0.1 API with no compatibility shims; each removed name's replacement is listed below.

- **Extensions replace plugins**: `defineExtension(name, config)` in `@crustjs/extensions` returns a plain frozen config; `.use()` is removed. Extension behavior lives in named `hooks` — `preRun(ctx)` (return `ctx.finish()` to short-circuit successfully), `postRun(ctx, outcome)` (runs in reverse extension order after every settled invocation), and `onError(error, ctx)` (return `true` after rendering an `execute()` failure). Extension-contributed commands are `defineCommand()` definitions (`ExtensionCommand` is removed), and `execute()` offers `AbortError` cancellation to `onError` hooks for central rendering (exit code stays `130`, silent when unclaimed).
- **`define*` helpers name every definition**: `defineCommand`, `defineContext`, `defineExtension`, `defineFlag`, `defineArg`. Builder methods are variadic and accumulative — `.flags(...defs)` replaces `.flags(record)`, `.args(...defs)` replaces `.args(tuple)` — with duplicate names, spellings, and aliases rejected as `DEFINITION` errors, most at compile time. `.action()` is set-once.
- **Commands are inert reusable definitions**: `defineCommand(name, { description, usage, aliases, hidden }, recipe)` attached with the checked variadic `.add(...definitions)`; use `.as(newName)` to reuse one definition under multiple names. `.sub()`, `.command()`, `.meta()`, and `ChildCrust` are removed; root metadata moves to `new Crust(name, { description, usage })`.
- **Contexts are declared lazy command dependencies**: `defineContext(name, { flags?, uses? }, setup)` returns a factory attached with `.provide(...instances)` and consumed through lazy `ctx` properties. Contexts, reusable commands, and Extensions declare dependencies with `uses`; composition sites check the graph. Context-owned flags are the only flag-propagation mechanism (`FlagDef.inherit` and `FlagSnapshot.inherit` are removed); `.of(value)` creates dependency-free test doubles; Context values are disposed via `Symbol.dispose`/`Symbol.asyncDispose` in reverse construction order.
- **Actions and execution**: `.action(action)` replaces `.handle()` and defines the Command Action; `.run(path, input, { stdout, stderr })` throws for programmatic embedding; `.execute()` renders and sets `process.exitCode`. Builder-level `preRun`/`postRun` are removed — lifecycle work moves to Extension hooks.
- **Errors**: `CrustError` keeps four stable codes (`DEFINITION`, `PARSE`, `VALIDATION`, `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`); `_tag`, `CONFIG`, and `EXECUTION` are removed; action and Context errors pass through unwrapped.
- **Validation**: Standard Schema is supported directly on arg/flag definitions; `@crustjs/validate` is removed.
- **Tooling**: `Crust.snapshot()` is the supported API for frozen, validated Command Snapshots; public `CommandNode`/`prepareCommandTree()` are removed, and man/crust/skills render help, man pages, and Agent Skills from one shared command documentation model.
- **Generics**: the generic parameters on `Crust`, `CommandDefinitionBuilder`, and the Context types were reordered and re-purposed; prefer inference over positional annotations.
- `create-crust` ships a single minimal template.
