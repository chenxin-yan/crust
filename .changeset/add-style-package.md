"@crustjs/style": patch
---

Introduce @crustjs/style — a terminal styling foundation for Crust with ANSI-safe styling primitives, color mode awareness (auto/always/never), ANSI-aware text layout utilities, list and table block helpers, and a semantic markdown theme covering all GFM constructs. Zero runtime dependencies.
