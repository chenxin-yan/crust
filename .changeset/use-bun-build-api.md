"@crustjs/crust": patch
---

Replace `Bun.spawn` with programmatic `Bun.build()` API for compilation, enabling self-compiled standalone crust binaries that can compile user CLIs without a separate Bun installation. Add `--outdir/-d` flag for configurable output directory. Update resolver shebang to `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
