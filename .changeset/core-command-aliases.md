Add `aliases` to `CommandMeta`.

Commands and subcommands can now declare alternative names that resolve to the same command node:

```ts
new Crust("my-cli").command("issue", (cmd) =>
  cmd.meta({ aliases: ["issues", "i"] }).run(() => {}),
);
// my-cli issue, my-cli issues, and my-cli i all route to the same command
```

The change is purely additive at the type level — existing code that does not set `aliases` is unchanged. `resolveCommand` gains a fast path that scans sibling `meta.aliases` on miss; `commandPath` continues to record the canonical name only, so error messages, help titles, and downstream plugins are unaffected by which alias the user typed. `CrustError("COMMAND_NOT_FOUND")`'s `details.available` keeps its canonical-only contract — alias-aware consumers (e.g. `didYouMeanPlugin`) read aliases directly from `details.parentCommand.subCommands`.

Alias collisions are eagerly rejected at registration time with `CrustError("DEFINITION", …)`. Plugin-installed subcommands (via the `addCommand` setup action) get the same check and are skipped with a warning if their canonical name or any alias collides — mirroring how a colliding canonical name was already handled. `validateCommandTree` re-runs the full check against the final tree. An alias may not equal the command's own canonical name, any sibling's canonical name, or any sibling's alias; aliases must be non-empty, contain no whitespace, and not start with `-`.
