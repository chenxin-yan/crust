Add `@crustjs/validate` package with Zod 4 and Effect schema-first validation for CLI commands.

`defineZodCommand` uses Zod schemas as the single source of truth — parser definitions, help text, runtime validation, and handler types are all derived from the schemas. Includes `arg()` and `flag()` DSL helpers, compile-time variadic/alias validation, and structured `CrustError("VALIDATION")` errors.

Core changes: export `ValidateFlagAliases` and `ValidateVariadicArgs` utilities, add `ValidationErrorDetails` type to `VALIDATION` error code, and generalize compile-time validation types to work with any record/tuple shape.
