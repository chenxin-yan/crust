Add `updateNotifierPlugin` to `@crustjs/plugins`. The plugin checks the npm registry for newer versions of your package and displays a non-blocking update notice after command execution. It is non-persistent by default, supports optional cache adapters (including `@crustjs/store`) for cross-run caching and dedupe, and uses package-manager-aware update commands with override support. Adopted in the `crust` CLI and the `create-crust` scaffold template by default.
